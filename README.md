# Whiteout Interactive Map

## Overview

**Whiteout Interactive Map** is a full-stack web application that provides an interactive map experience for users. Built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB (via Mongoose), it allows users to explore, interact with, and manage map data dynamically. The project is containerized with Docker for easy deployment and scalability.

_For screenshots and a detailed app presentation, see [docs/presentation.md](docs/presentation.md)._

## Lite Version

A **Lite version** of the project is also available for browser-only use.

Do you want me to also add a little comparison list (e.g. "Full version = with backend & Docker | Lite version = static browser app") so readers immediately see the difference?

## Features

- **Interactive Map UI:** Explore and interact with a dynamic map interface.
- **Building & Location Management:** Add, edit, and view buildings or points of interest.
- **RESTful API:** Backend API for CRUD operations on map data.
- **User Authentication:** Secure endpoints and manage user sessions (no password or roles for the moment).
- **Whiteout API Integration:** Authenticate users and redeem gift codes through the official Whiteout API.
- **Automated CAPTCHA Solving:** ML-based CAPTCHA solver for seamless gift code redemption.
- **Dockerized Deployment:** Easily run the entire stack with Docker Compose.
- **Environment Configuration:** Flexible setup via `.env` file.

## How It Connects to Whiteout

This application connects to the official Whiteout gift code API (`wos-giftcode-api.centurygame.com`) to:

1. **Authenticate Users:** Validates player Furnace IDs (FID) with the Whiteout API
2. **Retrieve Player Data:** Fetches player information including nickname, level, and avatar
3. **Redeem Gift Codes:** Automatically redeems gift codes for multiple accounts
4. **Solve CAPTCHAs:** Uses an ML-based Python service to solve CAPTCHAs required for redemption

### Authentication Flow

```
User enters FID → Backend signs request with MD5 → Whiteout API validates
→ Returns player data → Backend generates auth token → User logged in
```

### Gift Code Redemption Flow

```
User submits code → For each user: Login → Fetch CAPTCHA → Solve CAPTCHA
→ Submit code with solution → Handle retries → Return results
```

## Acknowledgements

The gift code redeem service implementation is adapted from the work in whiteout-project/bot
While this project doesn’t run through Discord, parts of the code and logic were inspired by their implementation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) & [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- (Optional) Local or cloud MongoDB instance

---

### Local Development Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd wos-interractive-map
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Install dependencies for both the backend and frontend:

   ```bash
   cd wos-interactive-map-back
   npm install

   cd ../wos-interactive-map-front
   npm install
   ```

   Return to the project root when done.

3. **Configure Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following content:

   ```env
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/mapBuildings
   PORT=5000
   ALLOWED_HOST=localhost
   ```

   - Adjust `MONGO_URI` if using a remote MongoDB.
   - Set `PORT` to your preferred port.
   - Set `ALLOWED_HOST` for CORS or domain restrictions.

4. **Start the Application**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The server will run at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) (or your chosen port).

---

### Docker Deployment

1. **Build and Start with Docker Compose**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   This will:
   - Build the Node.js app image.
   - Start the app and a MongoDB container.
   - Expose ports as defined in `docker-compose.yml`.

2. **Environment Variables for Docker**

   - By default, Docker Compose uses the environment variables set in `docker-compose.yml`.
   - To override, create a `.env` file or edit the `environment` section in `docker-compose.yml`.

3. **Stopping the Application**

   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

---

## Usage

- Access the interactive map at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) (or your configured host/port).
- Use the UI to view, add, or edit map buildings and locations.
- API endpoints are available for programmatic access.
